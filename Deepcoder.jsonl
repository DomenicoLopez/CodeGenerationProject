It then subtracts the value from the number. This process is repeated until the number is 0.\n\nThe function returns the roman numeral string in lowercase.\n\nLet's test the function with the provided examples:\n\nprint(int_to_mini_roman(19))  # Output: 'xix'\nprint(int_to_mini_roman(152))  # Output: 'clii'\nprint(int_to_mini_roman(426))  # Output: 'cdxxvi'\n\nAs you can see, the function correctly converts the given integers to their roman numeral equivalents."}

Then it checks if the square of the sum of the smallest two sides is equal to the square of the largest side. If it is, then the triangle is a right-angled triangle, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`."}
{"task_id": "HumanEval/158", "completion": "Here is a Python solution for the problem:\n\ndef find_max(words):\n    max_unique = 0\n    max_word = \"\"\n    for word in words:\n        unique_chars = len(set(word))\n        if unique_chars > max_unique:\n            max_unique = unique_chars\n            max_word = word\n        elif unique_chars == max_unique:\n            if word < max_word:\n                max_word = word\n    return max_word\n\nThis function works by iterating over each word in the input list. For each word, it calculates the number of unique characters by converting the word to a set (which automatically removes duplicates) and then taking the length of the set. If this number is greater than the current maximum number of unique characters, it updates the maximum and the corresponding word. If the number of unique characters is equal to the current maximum, it compares the words lexicographically and updates the word if it comes before the current maximum word.\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n*m), where n is the number of words and m is the length of the longest word. This is because for each word, we are iterating over all of its characters to create a set."}
{"task_id": "HumanEval/159", "completion": "Here is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\ndef eat(number, need, remaining):\n    total_eaten = number + need\n    if total_eaten > remaining:\n        remaining_carrots = 0\n    else:\n        remaining_carrots = remaining - total_eaten\n    return [total_eaten, remaining_carrots]\n\nThis function first calculates the total number of carrots eaten by adding the number of carrots eaten and the number of carrots needed. If this total is greater than the remaining carrots, the remaining carrots are set to 0. Otherwise, the remaining carrots are calculated by subtracting the total eaten from the remaining carrots. The function then returns a list containing the total number of eaten carrots and the number of remaining carrots."}
{"task_id": "HumanEval/160", "completion": "Here is a Python solution using the built-in `eval` function. This function evaluates a string as a Python expression and returns the result.\n\ndef do_algebra(operator, operand):\n    expression = str(operand[0])\n    for i in range(len(operator)):\n        expression += operator[i] + str(operand[i+1])\n    return eval(expression)\n\nThis function works by first converting the first operand to a string and storing it in `expression`. Then, for each operator, it adds the operator and the next operand to `expression`. Finally, it evaluates `expression` as a Python expression and returns the result.\n\nFor example, if `operator` is `['+', '*', '-']` and `operand` is `[2, 3, 4, 5]`, the function will return `9`.\n\nPlease note that using `eval` can be dangerous if you're not sure about the safety of the input, as it can execute any Python code. In this case, we're sure that the input is safe because it's a string representation of a simple arithmetic expression."}

If it doesn't, it simply reverses the string. If it does contain letters, it goes through each character in the string and checks if it's a letter. If it is, it swaps its case. If it's not, it leaves it as is. The `join` function is used to combine all the characters back into a single string."}

If it is, it returns None. If it's not, it encodes the string into bytes using the encode() method, then computes the md5 hash of the bytes using the hashlib.md5() function. Finally, it converts the hash into a hexadecimal string using the hexdigest() method."}

If it is, it swaps the values of `a` and `b`. Then it uses a list comprehension to generate a list of all even numbers between `a` and `b` inclusive. The `%` operator is used to check if a number is even, as it returns the remainder of the division of the number by 2. If the remainder is 0, the number is even."}
