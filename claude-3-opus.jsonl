The function takes two parameters: `numbers` (a list of floats) and `threshold` (a float).\n\n2. We use nested loops to compare each pair of numbers in the list.\n   - The outer loop `i` iterates over the indices of the list from 0 to the second-to-last element.\n   - The inner loop `j` iterates over the indices from `i + 1` to the last element.\n\n3. For each pair of numbers `numbers[i]` and `numbers[j]`, we calculate the absolute difference between them using `abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j])`.\n\n4. If the absolute difference is less than the given `threshold`, it means we have found two numbers that are closer to each other than the threshold. In this case, we immediately return `True`.\n\n5. If we complete both loops without finding any pair of numbers closer than the threshold, we return `False`.\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n^2) since we are using nested loops to compare each pair of numbers.

We initialize an empty list `result` to store the separated groups of parentheses, an empty stack `stack` to keep track of the opening parentheses, and an empty string `current_group` to build the current group of parentheses.\n\n2. We iterate over each character `char` in the input string `paren_string`:\n   - If `char` is a space, we ignore it and continue to the next character.\n   - If `char` is an opening parenthesis '(', we append it to the `stack` and add it to the `current_group`.\n   - If `char` is a closing parenthesis ')', we check if the `stack` is not empty:\n     - If the `stack` is not empty, we pop the top element from the `stack` and add the closing parenthesis to the `current_group`.\n     - If the `stack` becomes empty after popping, it means we have found a complete group of parentheses.

We initialize a variable `count` to keep track of the number of times the substring is found.\n2. We also initialize a variable `start` to keep track of the starting index for each search.\n3. We start a loop that continues until the substring is no longer found in the string.\n4. Inside the loop, we use the `find()` method to search for the substring in the string, starting from the `start` index.\n   - If the substring is found, `find()` returns the index where it is found.\n   - If the substring is not found, `find()` returns -1.\n5. If the substring is not found (i.e., `index` is -1), we break out of the loop.\n6. If the substring is found, we increment the `count` by 1.\n7. We update the `start` index to `index + 1` to start the next search from the character after the current occurrence of the substring.\n8. After the loop ends, we return the final value of `count`, which represents the number of times the substring was found in the string.\n\nThis implementation handles overlapping cases correctly. For example, in the case of `how_many_times('aaaa', 'aa')`, it correctly counts the overlapping occurrences of 'aa' and returns 3.\n\nThe function also handles edge cases, such as an empty string or substring, as shown in the provided doctests."}

We split the input string `numbers` into a list of individual number words using the `split()` method. This gives us a list of strings representing each number word.\n\n3. We use the `sorted()` function to sort the `number_list` based on a custom key function. The key function `lambda x: number_map[x]` maps each number word to its corresponding integer value using the `number_map` dictionary. This allows the sorting to be based on the actual numeric values rather than the alphabetical order of the words.\n\n4.

The function first checks if the number of coefficients is even and if the largest coefficient is non-zero. If either condition is not met, it raises a `ValueError`.\n\n2. It defines the tolerance and maximum number of iterations for the bisection method.\n\n3. It initializes the left and right bounds of the search interval to -1 and 1, respectively.\n\n4. It enters a loop that performs the bisection method for a maximum of `max_iterations` iterations.\n\n5. In each iteration, it calculates the midpoint `mid` of the current interval and evaluates the polynomial at `mid` using the `poly` function.\n\n6. If the absolute value of the evaluated polynomial at `mid` is less than the tolerance, it means a zero point is found, and the function returns `mid`.\n\n7. If the product of the evaluated polynomial at `mid` and the evaluated polynomial at the left bound is negative, it means the zero point lies in the left half of the interval. So, it updates the right bound to `mid`.\n\n8. Otherwise, the zero point lies in the right half of the interval, and it updates the left bound to `mid`.\n\n9. If the maximum iterations are reached without finding a zero point within the tolerance, the function returns the midpoint of the final interval as an approximation.\n\nThe bisection method guarantees convergence to a zero point if the polynomial has an odd degree and the largest coefficient is non-zero.

We initialize `result` to 1 and `base` to 2.\n2. We use a while loop to iterate as long as `n` is greater than 0.\n3. Inside the loop, we check if `n` is odd by using the modulo operator `%`.

This is done to efficiently calculate the powers of 2.\n5. We update `n` by dividing it by 2 using integer division `//`.\n6. After the loop ends, we return the final value of `result`, which represents 2^n modulo p.\n\nThis implementation uses the concept of modular exponentiation and binary exponentiation to efficiently calculate the result.

We define a string `vowels` that contains all the vowels (both lowercase and uppercase).\n2. We use a list comprehension to iterate over each character (`char`) in the input `text`.\n3. For each character, we check if it is not present in the `vowels` string using the `not in` operator.\n4. If the character is not a vowel, it is included in the resulting list.\n5.

Inside the loop, we compare the element at index `i` with the corresponding element at index `n - 1 - i` (the mirror position from the end of the array).\n\n5. If the elements at the mirror positions are not equal, it means we need to change one of them to make the array palindromic. We increment the `changes` variable by 1.\n\n6. After the loop ends, we have counted the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the array palindromic.\n\n7. Finally, we return the value of `changes`.\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the array, as we only iterate over half of the array once. The space complexity is O(1) since we only use a constant amount of extra space.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."}

After the loop ends, we return the final value of `sum_even_at_odd`, which represents the sum of all even elements at odd indices in the list.\n\nExample usage:\nresult = add([4, 2, 6, 7])\nprint(result)  # Output: 2\n\nIn this example, the list `[4, 2, 6, 7]` is passed to the `add` function. The function iterates over the elements at odd indices (index 1 and 3) and checks if they are even. The element at index 1 is 2, which is even, so it is added to the sum. The element at index 3 is 7, which is odd, so it is not added to the sum. Finally, the function returns the sum of even elements at odd indices, which is 2."}

We initialize an empty list called `coordinates` to store the coordinates of the occurrences of `x` in the nested list.\n\n2. We use a nested loop to iterate over each row and each element within the row:\n   - The outer loop iterates over each row in `lst` using `enumerate()` to get both the row index (`row_idx`) and the row itself (`row`).\n   - The inner loop iterates over each element in the current row using `enumerate()` to get both the column index (`col_idx`) and the value (`value`).\n\n3.

After finding all the occurrences of `x` and storing their coordinates in `coordinates`, we sort the list based on the given criteria:\n   - We use the `sort()` method with a custom `key` function.\n   - The `key` function is a lambda function that takes a coordinate tuple (`coord`) and returns a tuple `(coord[0], -coord[1])`.\n   - This sorting key ensures that the coordinates are sorted primarily by rows in ascending order (`coord[0]`), and secondarily by columns in descending order (`-coord[1]`).\n\n5.

First, we replace all commas in the string with spaces using the `replace()` method. This ensures that all words are separated by spaces, regardless of whether they were originally separated by commas or spaces.\n\n2. Next, we use the `split()` method to split the string into words.

First, we check if `n` is greater than `m`. If it is, we return -1 as per the problem statement.\n\n2. If `n` is not greater than `m`, we calculate the average of the integers from `n` to `m` (inclusive) using the formula `(n + m) / 2`. This works because the sum of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated as `(first term + last term) * (number of terms) / 2`. In this case, `n` is the first term, `m` is the last term, and the number of terms is `(m - n + 1)`. However, since we only need the average, we can simplify the formula to `(n + m) / 2`.\n\n3. We round the calculated average to the nearest integer using the `round()` function and store it in the variable `rounded_avg`.\n\n4. We convert the rounded average to its binary representation using the `bin()` function, which returns a string starting with \"0b\" followed by the binary digits. We store the binary representation in the variable `binary_avg`.\n\n5.

If the length of the array is 0 or 1, it is already sorted, so we return `True`.\n\n2. We create a new array `sorted_arr` by sorting the original array `arr` in non-decreasing order.\n\n3. We iterate through all possible right shift operations by using a loop from 0 to `n-1`, where `n` is the length of the array.\n\n4. In each iteration, we perform a right shift operation by concatenating the sliced array `arr[i:]` (elements from index `i` to the end) with `arr[:i]` (elements from the beginning to index `i-1`).\n\n5. We compare the right-shifted array with the sorted array `sorted_arr`. If they are equal, it means that the right-shifted array is in non-decreasing order, so we return `True`.\n\n6. If none of the right shift operations result in a sorted array, we return `False`.\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n^2) in the worst case, where n is the length of the array, as we iterate through all possible right shift operations and compare the arrays. The space complexity is O(n) to store the sorted array.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."}

We start by counting the number of odd numbers in `lst1` using a list comprehension and the `sum()` function. The expression `num % 2 != 0` evaluates to `True` for odd numbers and `False` for even numbers. By summing up these boolean values, we get the count of odd numbers in `lst1`.\n\n2. Similarly, we count the number of even numbers in `lst2` using a list comprehension and the `sum()` function. The expression `num % 2 == 0` evaluates to `True` for even numbers and `False` for odd numbers. By summing up these boolean values, we get the count of even numbers in `lst2`.\n\n3. To determine if it is possible to exchange elements between `lst1` and `lst2` to make all elements in `lst1` even, we compare the count of odd numbers in `lst1` with the count of even numbers in `lst2`.\n\n4. If the count of odd numbers in `lst1` is less than or equal to the count of even numbers in `lst2`, it means we have enough even numbers in `lst2` to replace all the odd numbers in `lst1`. In this case, we return \"YES\".\n\n5.

We split the input string `test` into a list of letters using `test.split()`. This separates the letters based on the space delimiter.\n\n2. We create an empty dictionary called `count_dict` to store the count of each letter.\n\n3. We iterate over each letter in the `letters` list and update the count in the `count_dict` dictionary.

We use a list comprehension to iterate over each character in `s` and include it in the result string only if it is not found in `c`. The `join()` method is used to concatenate the characters into a single string.\n\n2. Next, we check if the `result` string is a palindrome. We compare the `result` string with its reverse using slicing (`result[::-1]`). If the `result` string is equal to its reverse, it means it is a palindrome, and we assign `True` to the `is_palindrome` variable. Otherwise, `is_palindrome` will be `False`.\n\n3.

This ensures that any valid sub-array sum will be smaller than the initial value of `min_sum`.\n\n2. We initialize `current_sum` to 0, which represents the current sum of the sub-array being considered.\n\n3. We iterate through each element `num` in the input array `nums`.\n\n4. For each element, we update `current_sum` by taking the minimum of two values:\n   - `num`: This represents starting a new sub-array from the current element.\n   - `current_sum + num`: This represents extending the existing sub-array by including the current element.\n\n   By taking the minimum of these two values, we ensure that if the current sub-array sum becomes positive and is not contributing to the minimum sum, we start a new sub-array from the current element.\n\n5.

The tuple consists of two values:\n   - `count_ones(x)`: The count of ones in the binary representation of `x`.\n   - `x`: The original value of `x`.\n\n4. The `sorted()` function sorts the array based on the tuples returned by the lambda function. It first compares the count of ones (`count_ones(x)`), and if the counts are the same, it compares the original values (`x`).

This slice contains the first `k` elements of the sorted array, which are the maximum `k` numbers in `arr`.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the length of the input array `arr`. The space complexity is O(1) since we are modifying the array in-place and returning a slice of it.\n\nNote: The given constraints ensure that the input array will have at least one element and that `k` will be a valid positive integer within the range of the array length."}

In the `order_by_points` function, we use the `sorted` function to sort the list of integers `nums`. The `sorted` function takes a key function as an argument, which determines the sorting order.\n\n3. The key function is defined using a lambda expression: `lambda x: (digit_sum(x), nums.index(x))`. It takes each number `x` from the list and returns a tuple containing two values:\n   - The first value is the result of calling `digit_sum(x)`, which represents the sum of the digits of the number.\n   - The second value is `nums.index(x)`, which represents the original index of the number in the list.\n\n4. The `sorted` function sorts the list based on the key function. It first compares the digit sum of each number.

We start by sorting the side lengths in ascending order using the `sorted()` function. This ensures that the longest side is always the last element in the `sides` list.\n\n2. According to the Pythagorean theorem, in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the longest side) is equal to the sum of squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\n3.

We iterate over each word in the `words` list.\n\n3. For each word, we calculate the number of unique characters using `len(set(word))`. The `set()` function creates a set of unique characters in the word, and `len()` gives us the count of unique characters.\n\n4.

If the number of unique characters in the current word is equal to `max_unique_chars`, we append the current word to `max_words`.\n\n6. After iterating through all the words, we check the length of `max_words`:\n   - If `max_words` contains only one word, we return that word.\n   - If `max_words` contains multiple words with the same maximum number of unique characters, we sort the list lexicographically using `sorted()` and return the first word.\n\nThe function handles the given examples correctly:\n- `find_max([\"name\", \"of\", \"string\"])` returns `\"string\"` because it has the maximum number of unique characters (6).\n- `find_max([\"name\", \"enam\", \"game\"])` returns `\"enam\"` because both \"name\" and \"enam\" have the maximum number of unique characters (4), but \"enam\" comes first lexicographically.\n- `find_max([\"aaaaaaa\", \"bb\", \"cc\"])` returns `\"aaaaaaa\"` because all words have only one unique character, so the first word is returned."}

We import the `hashlib` module, which provides functions for generating cryptographic hashes.\n\n2. Inside the `string_to_md5` function, we first check if the input `text` is an empty string. If it is, we return `None` as specified in the function description.\n\n3. If `text` is not an empty string, we proceed to calculate its MD5 hash:\n   - We use `text.encode('utf-8')` to convert the string to bytes using the UTF-8 encoding. This is necessary because the `hashlib.md5()` function expects bytes as input.\n   - We pass the encoded bytes to `hashlib.md5()` to create an MD5 hash object.\n   - We call the `hexdigest()` method on the hash object to obtain the hexadecimal representation of the MD5 hash.\n\n4.

This handles the case where the function is called with `a` greater than `b`, such as `generate_integers(8, 2)`.\n\n2.
